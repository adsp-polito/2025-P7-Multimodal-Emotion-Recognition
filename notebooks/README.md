# Notebooks Folder

This directory contains all Jupyter notebooks developed throughout the **Multimodal Emotion Recognition Using Large Language Models** project. The notebooks support exploratory analysis, data preparation, model evaluation, and experimentation. They serve as a bridge between conceptual design and implementation, providing an interactive environment for testing ideas and documenting technical progress.

## Folder Structure

### 1. Data Exploration and Preparation  
Notebooks focused on loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing the dataset. This section prepares data for zero-shot evaluation and fine-tuning stages.  
- `data_inspection.ipynb` (to be added later)

### 2. Zero-Shot Evaluation  
Notebooks used to run baseline experiments with the chosen MLLM in zero-shot mode. These notebooks document early performance, prompt engineering attempts, and error analysis.  
- `zero_shot_eval.ipynb` (to be added later)

### 3. Fine-Tuning and Model Development  
Notebooks dedicated to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) experiments, training procedures, and hyperparameter exploration.  
- `fine_tuning_peft.ipynb` (to be added later)

### 4. Model Comparison and Analysis  
Notebooks created to compare zero-shot and fine-tuned models, compute metrics, run evaluations, and generate plots.  
- (To be added during mid and final development phases.)
